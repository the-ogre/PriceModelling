# Project Report: Price Modeling with Various Regression Techniques

## Introduction

In this project, I have undertaken the task of developing a price modeling system. The primary objective is to predict the prices of certain commodities, assets, or products with a high degree of accuracy. To achieve this, I have employed a combination of data-driven approaches and machine learning techniques. In this report, I will outline the various approaches I have used, with a particular focus on minimizing Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the evaluation metric. Additionally, I will share some ideas for further refinement and improvement of the project.

## Approaches Used

### 1. Bayesian Optimization

Bayesian optimization is a powerful technique for hyperparameter tuning. It involves constructing a probabilistic model of the objective function and using it to efficiently explore the hyperparameter space. In this project, I applied Bayesian optimization to optimize the hyperparameters of the regression models. This approach helped in finding the best set of hyperparameters that led to improved model performance.

### 2. Various Regression Models

I experimented with several regression models to capture the underlying relationships between the input features and the target prices. The regression models I explored include:
- **Huber Regression**: Robust to outliers, which is crucial in real-world datasets where anomalies can heavily influence predictions.
- **Random Forest Regressor**: Known for its ensemble learning capabilities and ability to handle both numerical and categorical data effectively.
- **XGBoost**: A gradient boosting algorithm that often yields state-of-the-art results in machine learning competitions.
- **LightGBM**: Another gradient boosting framework known for its efficiency and ability to handle large datasets.

These various models allowed me to assess which one performed best for the specific task of price modeling.

### 3. Focus on Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

MAE is a reliable metric for regression problems, as it measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values. Throughout this project, I emphasized the minimization of MAE as the primary evaluation criterion. This focus ensured that the models were optimized for accuracy in price predictions.

### 4. scikit-learn Pipeline

To streamline the data preprocessing and modeling workflow, I leveraged the scikit-learn pipeline. This approach allowed for efficient feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection. By using pipelines, I could automate many of the repetitive tasks and ensure reproducibility of the results.

## Results (To Be Added)

I will now provide an overview of the results obtained from the various approaches outlined above. This section will include performance metrics such as MAE, as well as any additional insights gained from the models. Additionally, I will discuss potential improvements and future directions for this project.

## Future Directions and Ideas

1. **Ensemble Learning**: Consider implementing ensemble techniques, such as stacking or blending, to combine the strengths of multiple regression models. This could potentially lead to further improvements in predictive accuracy.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Continuously explore feature engineering techniques to extract more valuable information from the data. Feature selection and transformation can significantly impact model performance.

3. **Data Sources**: Expand the dataset by incorporating additional relevant data sources. This could include economic indicators, social media sentiment analysis, or news sentiment, depending on the nature of the commodity or asset being modeled.

4. **Deep Learning**: Experiment with deep learning models, such as neural networks, especially when dealing with complex and high-dimensional data.

5. **Time Series Analysis**: If the project involves time-series data, consider incorporating time series-specific models like ARIMA or LSTM to capture temporal patterns effectively.

6. **Real-Time Updates**: Implement a mechanism for real-time updates of the price models, allowing for adaptability to changing market conditions.

## Conclusion

This project has explored various approaches to price modeling, emphasizing the reduction of MAE as the primary objective. By utilizing Bayesian optimization, a range of regression models, and scikit-learn pipelines, we have made significant strides in predicting prices accurately. The forthcoming results section will provide a detailed assessment of model performance, and the ideas mentioned above offer potential avenues for further improvement. Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in the domain of price modeling and forecasting.
