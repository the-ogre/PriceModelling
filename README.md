# Project Report: Price Modeling with Various Regression Techniques

## Introduction

In this project, I have undertaken the task of developing a price modeling system. The primary objective is to predict the prices of certain commodities, assets, or products with a high degree of accuracy. To achieve this, I have employed a combination of data-driven approaches and machine learning techniques. In this report, I will outline the various approaches I have used, with a particular focus on minimizing Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the evaluation metric. Additionally, I will share some ideas for further refinement and improvement of the project.

## Approaches Used

### 1. Bayesian Optimization

Bayesian optimization is a powerful technique for hyperparameter tuning. It involves constructing a probabilistic model of the objective function and using it to efficiently explore the hyperparameter space. In this project, I applied Bayesian optimization to optimize the hyperparameters of the regression models. This approach helped in finding the best set of hyperparameters that led to improved model performance.

### 2. Various Regression Models

I experimented with several regression models to capture the underlying relationships between the input features and the target prices. The regression models I explored include:
- **Huber Regression**: Robust to outliers, which is crucial in real-world datasets where anomalies can heavily influence predictions.
- **Random Forest Regressor**: Known for its ensemble learning capabilities and ability to handle both numerical and categorical data effectively.
- **XGBoost**: A gradient boosting algorithm that often yields state-of-the-art results in machine learning competitions.
- **LightGBM**: Another gradient boosting framework known for its efficiency and ability to handle large datasets.

These various models allowed me to assess which one performed best for the specific task of price modeling.

### 3. Focus on Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

MAE is a reliable metric for regression problems, as it measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values. Throughout this project, I emphasized the minimization of MAE as the primary evaluation criterion. This focus ensured that the models were optimized for accuracy in price predictions.

### 4. scikit-learn Pipeline

To streamline the data preprocessing and modeling workflow, I leveraged the scikit-learn pipeline. This approach allowed for efficient feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection. By using pipelines, I could automate many of the repetitive tasks and ensure reproducibility of the results.

## Final Model Selection and Deployment

In the culmination of this project, we have developed a robust price modeling system using a combination of data-driven approaches and machine learning techniques. The primary goal of this project was to predict prices of commodities, assets, or products with a high degree of accuracy, with a focus on minimizing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the evaluation metric.

### Data Preparation

The project began with loading and preprocessing the dataset, which included splitting it into training and test sets and performing standard scaling. This essential step ensured that the data was appropriately prepared for modeling.

### Dimensionality Reduction

To address the challenge of high-dimensional data and reduce the risk of overfitting, we implemented Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. This transformation allowed us to represent the complex feature space in a more manageable lower-dimensional form while preserving critical information.

### Model Selection: Huber Regression

After experimenting with various regression models, the Huber Regression model emerged as the most suitable choice. Huber Regression is a robust algorithm known for its resilience to outliers, making it particularly well-suited for real-world datasets where anomalies can significantly impact predictions.

### Model Evaluation

The performance of the Huber Regression model was thoroughly assessed using key regression metrics:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: This metric measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: It quantifies the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
- **R-squared (R²)**: An indicator of goodness of fit, measuring how well the regression model explains the variance in the data.

The Huber Regression model demonstrated robust performance with the following results:

- Mean Absolute Error: 3.0984
- Mean Squared Error: 18.0874
- R-squared: 0.7539

### Hyperparameter Tuning

To further optimize the Huber Regression model, we employed Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning. This process helped us identify the best combination of hyperparameters to enhance the model's performance. The optimized hyperparameters were as follows:

- Best Parameters: {'alpha': 0.0001, 'epsilon': 2.0}

### Streamlined Code Execution

To optimize the code execution process and enhance its efficiency, we integrated the 'tqdm' library. This provided a progress bar to monitor the execution of time-consuming tasks, such as Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. This optimization significantly improved the workflow's manageability and allowed for better tracking of time-consuming tasks.

### Final Model Performance

After hyperparameter tuning, we evaluated the final Huber Regression model with the optimized parameters. The results confirmed the model's effectiveness:

- Best Parameters: {'alpha': 0.0001, 'epsilon': 2.0}
- Mean Squared Error: 16.7353
- R² Score: 0.7723
- MAE: 3.0171

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project has successfully developed a price modeling system using various regression techniques, with the final deployment of the Huber Regression model. This model excels in predicting prices accurately while maintaining robustness to outliers, making it a valuable tool for pricing optimization, financial forecasting, and market analysis.

As a next step, further refinement and improvement of the project could involve exploring additional features, conducting ongoing monitoring of model performance, and adapting the system to real-world scenarios to ensure its continued effectiveness in a dynamic environment. The integration of 'tqdm' for code optimization serves as a testament to the commitment to improving efficiency and manageability in the development process.
